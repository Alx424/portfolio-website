        <p>I'm a grade 10 student interested in coding and all things programming!<br>I started learning how to code about 4 years ago, originally in Scratch, and started expanding to other coding languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Java.<br>I currently go to Sir Wilfrid Laurier CI and am a part of my school robotics club, where we build robots that participate in the <a src="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition</a> as team 5036. <br>I've created a number of projects in the past, most of which are showcased on this website!<br>Hope you enjoy!<br>--Alexander Kula</p>
